🧸💬 For working continuity when you need to change development environment and compatibilities, we are now developing our Games AI pilot on MACOS because of the market ( they discount 5,000 bath for MacBook M4 ) </br>
🐑💬 ➰ There are online documents, Google sheet application, and applications for multiple working OS environments, and there are native support applications for developers such as VSCode and Python, you can continue working on the new environment. Since Python works in multiple working environments, we can download and install Pygame and PLE Python learning environment to install and use same as Linux or Windows OS. </br>

All events and states need to be mapped and matched with the display console as a communication device where the user trusts the system by working in scopes of application working they gains more stability and practical in policy because proprietary also meaning they are authorized to perform by application flow and with response you are follows guideline automation. </br>
